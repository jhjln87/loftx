            <strong class="luminariText">Kasai Yama</strong><br>
            <p>Born into a rich family, 19 year old Kasai broke away from his Japanese heritage to live in America with his Korean grandmother. Even though he would rather be carefree and spend time helping his grandmother, Kasai is forced to be the adult in his friend group. Especially when their powers are put to the test against something they have never faced before.</p>

            <strong class="luminariText">Gabriel Smith</strong><br>
            <p>This fun-loving guy is all about the spotlight! Being 17, Gabriel disregards any sense of responsibility when it comes to what he and his friends have learned over the years about magic. Yet even the silliest of guys can turn harsh when all they love comes under fire. Especially when his girlfriend, Renee is the victim of such fire.</p>

            <strong class="luminariText">Renee Malker</strong><br>
            <p>At 16 years old, this smart cookie is already ahead of her academic and magical career. Or at least, she thinks she is. Tender-hearted and thoughtful, Renee uses her abilities to try and help everyone around her. Yet when being an older sister and student becomes too much, it really only takes two people who can calm her down; her boyfriend, Gabriel and her little brother, Ryan.</p>

            <strong class="luminariText">Lucas King</strong><br>
            <p>Having moved all his childhood due to being a military brat, 18 year old Lucas is the complete opposite of his battle hardened father. He gets quite nervous and that often leads to problems with his powers acting awry. He tries his best though. However, with a strong threat closing in, he must decide whether or not to face his fears alongside his friends.</p>

            <strong class="luminariText">Anauel Smith</strong><br>
            <p>Due to her twin, Gabriel not having any sense of responsibility, Ana sometimes has to be the voice of reason not only with her torn-apart family, but also with her friends. Though she carries a heavy weight, itâ€™s her laid-back attitude that really shines. People instantly gravitate towards her. But can she hold it together when everything seems to crumble?</p>

            <p>Is anything sweeter than being 12 years old with magical abilities? Not to Ryan! Wide eyed and full of wisdom in his young age, Ryan glides through his life with mindful ease. However, can he handle the pressure of growing up too fast when a new threat appears? Or will it prove to be too much for someone so young?</p>
